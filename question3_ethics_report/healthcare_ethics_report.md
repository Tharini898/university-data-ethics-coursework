# AI Ethics in Healthcare Data — Report Template

> Replace guidance text with your own writing. Keep within ~1000 words.

## Executive Summary
- One paragraph overview
- Key risks, safeguards, recommendations

## A. Healthcare Data Privacy Challenges
- Compare **HIPAA (US)** vs other regimes (e.g., Sri Lanka’s PDPA draft, EU GDPR)
- De-identification vs re-identification risk (quasi-identifiers)
- Research value vs privacy: data minimization, governance boards
- Specific challenges beyond GDPR (e.g., consent for secondary use, auditability)

## B. Algorithmic Bias in Medical AI
- Sources: skewed demographics, selection bias, label noise, device bias
- Impact: diagnostic disparities, triage inequities
- Fairness metrics: demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration
- Mitigation: data augmentation, reweighting, adversarial debiasing, post-hoc adjustments
- Real-world examples (cite): e.g., risk scores underestimating Black patients’ needs

## C. Ethical Decision-Making Framework
- Checklist (data ➜ model ➜ deployment ➜ monitoring)
- Informed consent in big data contexts
- Right to explanation & model interpretability (SHAP/LIME as examples)
- Predictive models implications (false positives/negatives)

## D. Stakeholder Impact Analysis
- Patients: safety, privacy, autonomy
- Providers: accountability, workload, trust in tools
- Researchers: data access, reproducibility, incentives
- Society/economy: access, affordability, global equity

## Technical Implementation & Reflection
- Note your code quality, tests, deployment approach
- 200-word reflection on learning & future work

## References
- Use academic citation style (APA/IEEE). Include authoritative sources.
